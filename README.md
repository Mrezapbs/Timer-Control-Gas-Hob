I started using Holtek MCUs programming about 6 months ago... They're easy to use and each peripheral can be set easily just by reading the datasheet. 
But the first days of working with these MCUs, I ran into small issues which could get fixed fast if there was a tutorial on the web. So I commit my 
first Holtek programming code in here in case anyone else tries to work with them.

This software controls 4 touch keys, 1 AC buzzer, 1 15-Pins display and 1 Output relay. Buzzer sound level, Backlight intensity , Clock , Cooking time
and delayed cooking program can be set. 

Hope you enjoy it!
